### Installing Docker on your machine

If you already have Docker installed on your computer, please ignore this section.

- For Windows users: It is recommended that you install WSL 2 from [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) before installing Docker as it is the preferred way to virtualize your containers.

You can download Docker Desktop from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

Once you go through the installation process, you can verify if Docker has been installed successfully by opening a terminal and running:

```bash
docker --version
```

```bash
docker-compose --version
```

If you get an error, please refer to the documentation [here](https://docs.docker.com/).

### Initializing the project on your machine

Next, create a new `.env` file in the repository root, and add the required environment variables to it. Please contact the repository maintainers for the environment variables.

### Running the API

Open a terminal in the root of the repository and run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build

```

\
To stop a container that is already running in your terminal, press CTRL+C to exit out of the container. Then, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

\
If you wish to run commands inside the Docker container, open a new terminal and
run the command:

```bash
docker exec -it insiit-api bash
```

Please note that this will be a Linux environment and any commands you run will be run inside the container. For example:

```console
PS C:\Users\Mayank> docker exec -it insiit-api bash
root@c9b3a93df5e9:/code# whoami
root
root@c9b3a93df5e9:/code# pwd
